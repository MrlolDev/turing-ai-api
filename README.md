Turing API is the official API from TuringAI and the best API for AI.

## Guide

We are working on libraries/sdks for the most famous programming languages.

Right now you can use the API by doing normal HTTP requests.

You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.turing.sh).

## Contributing

You can contribute to the API by making a pull request.

If you want to contribute to our libraries you need to go to the next repos:

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/TuringAI-Team/turing-library/tree/typescript)
- [Python](https://github.com/TuringAI-Team/turing-library/tree/python)

If you want to contribute to the documentation you need to go to the [models folder in this repo](https://github.com/TuringAI-Team/turing-ai-api/tree/new/src/models) or the docs file under the utils folder. You cannot contribute to the documentation by modifying the docs folder since the docs folder is autogenerated using the docs.ts filter based on the data extracted by the models.
You can run the docs.ts file by doing `npm run docs` and you can check [docs.page documentation](https://docs.page) to learn how to use the docs.ts file.
